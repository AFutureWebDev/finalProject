Why it needs to exist (what problem does it solve)?
I thought of this idea a while back when I was at the grocery store. I try to stay under a budget when I buy my groceries. I have a list app open on my phone and then have to switch to my calcualtor app to add up each item I put into my cart. I was constantly switching between apps. I thought "why not have both features in the same place." This app will make it easier for those to effficiently grocery shop and stay within their budget limits.

How it solves the problem:
The app will allow the user to not just have an organized groacery list, but be aware of their total amount during the duration of their shopping trip.

What the app is and how it works:
The app will allow you to put in a prefered budget amount. Create your list and head to the store. Then, as you cross an item off your list, another window will pop up and ask for the price of the item. Once entered, a running total of your current shopping cart will display. The background color of the app will change based on if you're under, close, or over budget (green, yellow, red).

Future Extensions:
Add a grocery Api to the app that categorizes the items in the list. Produce, dairy, snacks, toiletries, etc.

Save List - be able to save lists that you thought were helpful 

Favorite an item - be able to favorite an item that you always find yourself buying when you go to the store (more efficient way to add items to your list rather than typing them out each time)
